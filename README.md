# StackOverflow
## *This is a basic StackOverflow clone.* 

### Supports the following pages:

### Index
On the home page, the user sees a list of all the questions sorted by most recent first, along with the amount of likes, as well as the tags associated with that question. The title of the question is a link that takes the user to the question page.

### View Question
On the question page, the full text of the question is displayed, as well as the tags and likes for that question. Beneath that, all the answers for that question are displayed. If the user is currently logged in, they will also see a heart-shaped Like button next to the question to allow them to like it. Once a user has liked a question, the button will turn red and they will not be able to like it again. Also, logged in users will have a textbox underneath the question where they can post their own answer. 

### Ask a Question
If the current user is not logged in, they will be redirected to a login page. If they are logged in, they will be taken to a page where they can ask a question, and include any relevant tags.

### Login

### Signup
User can create an account, with their name, email address, and a password (which is then hashed, for security), to enable them to log in and post, like, and answer questions
